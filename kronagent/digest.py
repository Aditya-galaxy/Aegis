"""
The weekly digest: what shadow mode saw, decided and got wrong, for one tenant.

The roadmap asks for a weekly incident digest for design partners. The version
worth sending is not a highlights reel. A partner running Kronagent in shadow
mode needs four things from it, in this order:

  1. Anything that means the rest cannot be trusted — a broken audit chain, a
     containment that actually executed, an approval queue that has stopped
     being a control, or a week with no findings at all (which is how every
     ingestion wiring fault presents: silence, indistinguishable from a quiet
     account).
  2. What arrived and what Kronagent decided about it, including what triage
     dismissed.
  3. What it would have done — every planned containment, by action class.
  4. How that compared with what the team actually did, with every
     disagreement listed.

It deliberately contains no model-written text. Threat-intel summaries,
correlation prose and triage justifications are written by a model that read
attacker-influenced telemetry; a digest emailed to a customer is the last place
that text should appear unmarked. Counts, verdicts, action classes, severities
and the analysts' own notes only — asserted in tests/test_digest.py.

Nothing here sends anything. It renders; delivery is the operator's choice.
