"""
Render the deployable IAM artifacts from the one source that defines them.

`deploy/cloudformation/*.json` and `deploy/kronagent-iam-policy.json` describe
the same grant three times over. They were maintained by hand, and they had
drifted four separate ways — a policy name the adapter never writes, an action
nothing calls, a NACL grant covering every ACL in the account while the README
promised it covered one, and two missing read permissions without which
containment could not run at all.

They are generated now. `kronagent/connect.py` is the source; these files are
build output that happens to be committed, because a grant that exists only as
a function's return value is not something a security reviewer can read in a
pull request, and "the customer reads exactly what they are granting" is the
whole premise of splitting observe from contain.

    python3 deploy/publish_templates.py --check    # CI: fail on drift
    python3 deploy/publish_templates.py --write    # regenerate after a change

Publishing to S3 is deliberately not implemented here. No bucket exists, and a
half-written uploader is worse than none: it invites someone to point it at a
bucket without the verification that makes publishing safe (re-fetching each
object anonymously, the way a customer's browser will, and refusing to
overwrite a template someone may already have installed).
