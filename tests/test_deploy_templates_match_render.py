"""
The committed IAM artifacts are generated, and stay that way.

`deploy/cloudformation/*.json` and `deploy/kronagent-iam-policy.json` described
the same grant three times over, by hand. They had drifted four separate ways:
an inline policy name the adapter never writes, an action nothing calls, a NACL
grant covering every ACL in the account while `deploy/README.md` promised it
covered exactly one, and two missing read permissions without which containment
could not run at all. A fifth was asymmetric hardening — a region condition
present in one copy and absent from the other two.

None of that was carelessness. It is what maintaining one thing in three places
does, reliably, given time.

They render from `kronagent/connect.py` now. These tests are what stops that
regressing, and the load-bearing one is
`test_parameterized_and_baked_templates_grant_identical_policies`: it makes it
structurally impossible for the template a customer *downloads* and the template
a customer might one day *launch from a console link* to grant different things.
Generating both from one function is not sufficient on its own — the two forms
take different code paths through it, and only an assertion covers the gap.
